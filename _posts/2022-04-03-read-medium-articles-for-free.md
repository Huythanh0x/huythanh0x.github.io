<p><a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is a website that aggregates articles in the form of news and essays. The articles on this platform are of high quality and cover a wide range of topics. However, to read articles on this website, users have to pay a fee, and some internet service providers in Vietnam block access to this website. In this article, I will share some ways to access and read articles on Medium for free.</p>

<h3>Read articles on Medium for free</h3>
<h4>On Laptop/Desktop devices</h4>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Based on the website's principle</p>
<p>Medium allows a user to read up to 3 articles for free within a month. After that, the user has to pay a fee of around 120k/1 month to access more articles. However, users can still read articles without logging in, and the data on the number of articles read is stored in cookies. So, after reading 3 articles, you can <strong>clear your cookies</strong> to continue reading using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm?hl=en">Cookie Editor extension</a>. Alternatively, you can use the <strong>incognito mode</strong> of your browser each time you visit the website.</p>

<p>However, with this method, the website won't save your data to suggest similar articles, and you won't be able to save articles or take notes.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Use supporting extensions</p>
<p>At <a href="https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited">this page</a>, you will find instructions for installing and using the "Medium Unlimited" extension. After installing the "Medium Unlimited" extension, you will be able to access the website's content without any limitations on the number of reads.</p>

<p>With this method, you can store your reading history and make annotations. However, it can negatively impact the authors, as Medium pays authors based on the number of reads by users.</p>

<h4>On Android/iOS Mobile devices</h4>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Save articles and read them using <strong>Pocket</strong></p>

<p>If you're not familiar with it, "Pocket" is an application used to save webpages and articles you find on the Internet. In Pocket, articles are stored and downloaded in their entirety, not just partially.</p>

<p>After installing "Pocket" from the Google Play Store or App Store, follow these 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the article you want to read in the "Medium" app and share/save it to "Pocket".</li>
  <li>Tap on the Pocket icon.</li>
  <li>Select the article you saved in the "Pocket" app.</li>
</ol>

<style>
    .tripleImg {
    display:none;
}
    
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    .tripled {
        font-size: 0;
    }
    .firstImg {
      width: 33.3%;
    }
    .tripleImg {
      display:inline;
    }
}
</style>

<div class="gallery" style="border: 3px solid green;">
    <figure class="photo tripled">
        <img class='firstImg' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huythanh0x/LinhTinh/main/medium_for_free/share_to_pocked.jpg" alt="Great Rocket" width="100%">
        <img class='tripleImg' src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huythanh0x/LinhTinh/main/medium_for_free/open_pocket_from_medium.jpg" alt="Great Rocket" width="33.3%">

    </figure>
</div>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Use incognito mode, similar to the laptop/desktop method</p>
<p>Perform the same steps as mentioned above.</p>

<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Use cracked/modded versions</p>
<p>You can search for modded/cracked versions of the app on the Internet in the form of APK files. However, I do not recommend this method as it directly affects the income of Medium and the authors.</p>

<h3>Accessing Medium on unsupported networks</h3>
<h4>On Laptop/Desktop devices</h4>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use VPN extensions</p>
<p>You can download any VPN to "fake" your location to different countries and access Medium. Previously, I used <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-vpn-for-chrome-vpn-p/majdfhpaihoncoakbjgbdhglocklcgno?hl=en">VeePN</a> because it offers free access with high speed when selecting Singapore as the location.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Use Google's secure DNS</p>
<p>In Chrome settings, search for "security" and select the option as shown in the image below. This method does not affect the browsing speed compared to normal speed.</p>

<h4>On Android/iOS Mobile devices</h4>

<p>For mobile devices, you will need to use applications. Therefore, you need to install a third-party app such as VeePN, 1.1.1.1, or fastVPN. I am currently using **1.1.1.1** because it is free. You can search for methods to increase the free quota for 1.1.1.1 on Google.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>And there you have it! I have shared some ways to read articles on Medium for free. The articles on Medium are of high quality, as authors are paid for their writing. If you are able to, I recommend subscribing to "premium" to support the writers.</p>
