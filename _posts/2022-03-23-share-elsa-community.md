<h2>Pronunciation and Fundamental Knowledge in Language Learning</h2>
<p>Pronunciation is one of the fundamental aspects of language learning in general, and specifically in learning English. Building a strong foundation in pronunciation takes time and requires solid practice. When we pronounce words correctly, we can accurately understand what others say, and speaking with proper pronunciation boosts our confidence in communication. However, how can we know if we are pronouncing correctly while learning?</p>
<p>Based on my learning experience, I have created several Communities on ELSA with different learning paths to help address this challenge:</p>
